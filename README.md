# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I created a personal webpage for this cs50 project0.  Files were organized in directories according to their name.  There are 5 folders total: about, contact, images, portfolio, & rates.  Each one, with the exception of images, contains its own html file.  Bootstrap was implemented on rates.html.

One stylesheet was applied to all the html files.  It was created using SASS, then recompiled into a css file.  Style.css fulfills the requirements of this project by using one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance, as well as:

"(S)tylesheet must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens."
